# solana-blastfm-onchain
The Anchor's bootstrapped on-chain Rust program of [Blast.fm](https://github.com/Mueslint/blastfm-front) project to learn Rust and Solana with [buildspace](https://app.buildspace.so/home) community ^^

## The project
Following the original content of the tutorial from [buildspace](https://app.buildspace.so/home), I've decided to replace the GIF stuff with music players from spotify ID's
The name of the program and the so-called design is a pun to `last.fm` being very used in the 2000's as Spotify is nowadays for music sharing.

## State of the project
It implements a CRUD on spotify's track IDs, but as I was messing around with Solana CLI's I messed up badly with the wallet ID being used to deploy and now I'm stuck \o/
